                    at Bellevue University. He was born in Evansville, a city in southern Indiana that 
                    is situated on the Ohio River that also has the pleasure of being the 249th most 
                    populous city in the nation, as of the 2020 census. When Anachebe is not studying

                    Acting on the stage is among this favorite things to do. He is enamored with 
                    the camaraderie involved in bringing a script to life with a group of his peers, 
                    live in front of an audience. There is something about the fact that, in live 
                    performance, anything can happen and it would exist in the memory of the people 
                    there, then the performance ends and everyone goes home only to come back and 
                    repeat it again the next night.
